<div style="text-align:justify;"> 
My research interests include the theory and methods of optimization in the fields of sparse optimization, bilevel
optimization and Euclidean distance matrix optimization. </div> 

<div style="text-align:justify"> <span style="color:orange">**Sparse  optimization**.</span>  We established the exact recovery theory between $\ell_0$ minimization and the weighted $\ell_1$ minimization, sorts of optimality conditions as well as global and quadratic convergence properties of subspace Newton method for sparse optimization, and proposed several efficient first order methods <a href="https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/MIRL1">MIRL1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/IIHT">IIHT</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/HTPCP">HTPCP</a>, and a second order method <a href="https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/NHTP">NHTP</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/NHTPver2">NHTPver2</a>.  </div>

<div style="text-align:justify">  <span style="color:orange">**Euclidean distance matrix optimization**.</span> This is the topic of my <a href="https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/429739/">PhD thesis</a>, in which majorization techniques were adopted to design competitively fast algorithms equipped with two powerful solvers <a href="https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/PREEEDM">PREEEDM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/SQREDM">SQREDM</a>. </div>

</div> <span style="color:orange">**Bilevel optimization**.</span>   A Matlab-based <a href="https://biopt.github.io/">BiOpt Toolbox</a> has been created, aiming at providing a platform on which users can test a wide range collection of bilevel optimization examples from <a href="https://biopt.github.io/">BOLIBver2</a> through three our provided efficient solvers and several useful tools. </div>
