My research interests include the theory and methods of optimization in the fields of sparse optimization, bilevel
optimization and Euclidean distance matrix optimization. 

* <span style="color:orange">**Sparse  optimization**.</span> We established the exact recovery theory between $\ell_0$ minimization and its weighted $\ell_1$ version, sorts of optimality conditions as well as global and quadratic convergence properties of subspace ewton method for sparse optimization, and proposed several efficient first order methods [MIRL1](https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/MIRL1), [IIHT](https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/IIHT) and [HTPCP](https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/HTPCP), and a second order method [NHTP](https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/NHTP) or [NHTPver2](https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/NHTPver2). 

* <span style="color:orange">**Euclidean distance matrix optimization**.</span> This is the topic of my [PhD thesis](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/429739/), in which majorization techniques were adopted to design competitively fast algorithms equipped with two powerful solvers [PREEEDM](https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/PREEEDM) and [SQREDM](https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/SQREDM).

* <span style="color:orange">**Bilevel optimization**.</span> A Matlab-based [BiOpt Toolbox](https://biopt.github.io/) has been created, aiming at providing a platform on which users can test a wide range collection of  bilevel optimization examples from [BOLIBver2](https://biopt.github.io/bolib/) through three our provided efficient solvers and several useful tools .
